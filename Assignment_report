Food Ingredients and Allergens Dataset Analysis Report

1. Data Loading and Basic Inspection:
- Dataset loaded using pandas.
- Displayed the first 5 rows of the dataset to understand the structure.

2. NumPy Operations:
- Converted the "Main Ingredient" column to a NumPy array.
- Computed the length of each ingredient name and stored it in an integer array.
- Demonstrated various NumPy features: creating arrays (zeros, ones, identity), indexing, slicing, reshaping, concatenation, splitting.
- Used universal functions (sqrt, exp), aggregation (sum, mean), broadcasting, comparisons, fancy indexing, sorting, and partitioning.
- Created structured and record arrays for advanced manipulation.

3. Pandas Series and DataFrame Usage:
- Created a Series from "Main Ingredient" column.
- Accessed elements by position and slice.
- Demonstrated single and multiple column selection from DataFrame.
- Applied string operation (uppercase) to Series.
- Showed index-aligned operations and handling of missing data.
- Replaced missing values and filtered rows with null values.

4. Hierarchical Indexing:
- Created a multi-index DataFrame with "Main Ingredient" and "Food Product" as indices.

5. Data Concatenation and Merging:
- Concatenated two parts of the dataset vertically.
- Used pandas merge to join with an external ingredient info table.
- Demonstrated join operation using set_index.

6. Grouping and Aggregation:
- Grouped data by "Main Ingredient" and computed count of food products.
- Aggregated data using custom lambda to get most common allergen.

7. Pivot Tables and Visualization:
- Created a pivot table with "Main Ingredient" vs "Allergens" and filled missing values.
- Visualized the pivot table as a heatmap using matplotlib.
- Plotted a pie chart showing top 5 ingredients.
- Plotted a line chart showing top 15 ingredient frequencies.
